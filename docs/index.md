## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This project was dreamed up (read: copied) due to my desire to create a game engine that was:
1. Turn based
2. Simple enough to build on my own in a short amount of time
3. Relatable enough that I can envision it's implementation
4. Interesting enough that I stay engaged
5. Common enough that it has plenty of existing examples
6. Possibly recreatable with Pen and Paper

Honestly, I kinda made some of those up to fit my final decision to start this project, but they are all essentially nice-to-haves.

This engine is a re-implentation of the common "vector racer" game used to teach kids about vectors. In this case the focus isn't so much to teach vectors as it is to make a simple game fun and capable of fitting within a system of interesting graphics, level building, networking and portability.

I intend to build this into a game for iOS along with my current experiments into the iOS platform that can be viewed in my other repos. But JS compiles quickly and doesn't really crash and I know it well enough that I can put this together fairly quickly without concerning myself with language syntax and semantics. It could also lay the ground work for a game that could communicate between browser and other platforms.
