# TBS Racer prototype

Prototyping a vector racing game engine in JS for use in other projects


## Stuff used

- VSCode w/ Live server extension


## JS web

This project uses no transpiling, just whatever works with:
- Chrome v65


## Setup

1. Clone project, enter project root dir
2. Use a custom server or the live server extension for VSCode (if using VSCode...)
3. To view docs locally, (have jekyll installed), in `/docs` dir run: `bundle exec jekyll serve`


## Docs

The docs for this project are written in a journal style, if you want code documentation, just read the comments around the code as they are quite clear.

[View the docs on Github Pages](https://louisfoster.github.io/tbs-racer-prototype/), or, install Jekyll to view locally (don't ask me how, it took me forever and I'm sure it's different for each machine) - instructions are only a Google search away!


## About

The openness of this is intentional as I hope it might one day serve as a learning tool, or a terrible boilerplate, or as something I use to launch another interesting thing. I'm lucky enough to have the knowledge to understand most of what I'm doing in this project and will do my best to explain as I go along. If you think this is cool but want to contact me for some reason about this project, there are heaps of options with PRs and issues and comments and wiki etc etc.

Note, there is no plan to actively maintain this project if I stop, nor any liability for using the dodgy code I write. I'm doing this for my own fun.
